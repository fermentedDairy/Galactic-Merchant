## Problem Statement
```
Merchant’s Guide To The Galaxy

 

You decided to give up on earth after the latest financial collapse left 99.99% of the earth's

population with 0.01% of the wealth. Luckily, with the scant sum of money that is left in

your account, you are able to afford to rent a spaceship, leave earth, and fly all over the

galaxy to sell common metals and dirt (which apparently is worth a lot).

 

Galactic trading requires you to convert numbers and units, and you decided to write a

program to help you. The numbers used for intergalactic transactions follows a similar

convention to the roman numerals and you have painstakingly collected the appropriate

translation between them. Roman numerals are based on seven symbols.

 

Symbols and values

I=1
V=5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000

Numbers are formed by combining symbols together and adding the values. For example,
MMVI is 1000 + 1000 + 5 + 1 = 2006. Generally, symbols are placed in order of value,
starting with the largest values. When smaller values precede larger values, the smaller
values are subtracted from the larger values, and the result is added to the total. For
example MCMXLIV = 1000 + (1000 -100) + (50 -10) + (5 -1) = 1944.

The symbols "I", "X", "C", and "M" can be repeated three times in succession, but no more.
(They may appear four times if the third and fourth are separated by a smaller value, such
as XXXIX.)
"D", "L", and "V" can never be repeated.
"I" can be subtracted from "V" and "X" only. "X" can be subtracted from "L" and "C" only.
"C" can be subtracted from "D" and "M" only. "V", "L", and "D" can never be subtracted.
Only one small-value symbol may be subtracted from any large-value symbol.

A number written in Arabic numerals can be broken into digits. For example, 1903 is
composed of 1, 9, 0, and 3. To write the Roman numeral, each of the non-zero digits should
be treated separately.

In the above example, 1,000 = M, 900 = CM, and 3 = III. Therefore, 1903 = MCMIII.

Input to your program consists of lines of text detailing your notes on the conversion
between intergalactic units and roman numerals. You are expected to handle invalid
queries appropriately.

## Example Logic under Test
_Using examples_

glob prok Silver -> IV silver -> 4 silver -> 4 * 17 Credits -> 68 Credits

glob prok Gold -> IV Gold -> 4 Gold -> 4 * 14450 Credits -> 57800 Credits

glob prok Iron -> IV Iron -> 4 Iron -> 4 * 195.5 Credits -> 782 Credits
